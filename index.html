            Hey! I am Kai. Although I am a finance student, I realised how powerful coding really is. That is why I have come to learn how to use this skill to leverage the day-to-day life of any finance majors. 
            <br><br>
            Many people out there think of finance and tech as the hard thing to do. My aim is to learn the complexity of these skills and to simplify it for everyone so that we can be more literate with tech and finance. 
            <br><br>
            I use my free time to read and study business strategies of tech companies so that I don't fall into the trap that is similar to the DotCom Boom.
