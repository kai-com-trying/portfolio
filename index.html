        <p>
            Hey! I am Kai. Although I am a finance student, I realised how powerful really is. That is why I have come to learn how to use this skill to leverage the day-to-day life of any finance majors. 
            <br>
            Many people out there think of finance and tech as the hard thing to do. My aim is to learn the complexity of these skills and to simply it for everyone so that we can be more literate with tech and finance. 
            <br>
            In my free time, I like to take and edit photos and videos. I miss Europe...very much.
